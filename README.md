## 👾 TETRIS 

Welcome to React Tetris! This project is a recreation of the classic Tetris game built using React and JavaScript.

## Try it yourself

You can play the game live [here](https://tttetris.netlify.app/).

## 🕹️ How to play it

- Once you press start you will need to 

  - "Up" button for changing the position of the tetromino.
  - "Down" button for moving down faster.
  - "Left" and right" buttons for navigation the tetromino.

- You can always see your score and the rows you have wipped out.

- Once you make it to the top of your game you lose and game will stop.

- The more you play the more levels you'll pass which also means the faster the game gets.

- I bet you can't get passed level 4 🤷🏼‍♀️.


## ⚡ Technologies

- `React.js`
- `Javascript`

## 💭 Process:

One of my interests as being a gamer and having the abilty to code is to create games. This is a small step towards learning game development. 

I started by focusing on the game's functionality. I cared more that it worked correctly. 

The logic for creating a game is way different from web development but I tried to make as mean connections as I could to be able to understand very line of code.

After game was completed I had the struggles of how to showcase my work. I wanted to be able to keep the user longer on my site. And for that since I made a 
retro game I though maybe I should place it where I first played it, on a windows 98 home screen. 

## 🛠️ How can it be improved?

I would like to save the users highscore for users to be able to keep track of their progress. Create a game over display to show off the highscore.
